## Fix for Experimental Decorator Error
https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/45071
In VSCode, Go to File => Preferences => Settings (or Control+comma) and it will open the User Settings file. Add "javascript.implicitProjectConfig.experimentalDecorators": true to the file and it should fix it. It did for me.
